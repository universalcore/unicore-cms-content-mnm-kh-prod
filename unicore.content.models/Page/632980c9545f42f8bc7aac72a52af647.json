Here is how malaria affected Kenya:\r\n\r\n - 76% of the population of Kenya was living in an at-risk area where the malaria parasite was present.\r\n\r\n - It is estimated that 3,500,000 people caught the disease, and 12,000 died, just from a simple mosquito bite.\r\n\r\n - Malaria also cost the economy of Kenya approximately 68.25 Billion Kenyan Shillings in lost productivity and treatment costs.\r\n\r\n**How you can help**\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way.  You can help protect your family, and your country, from malaria by taking a few simple steps:\r\n\r\n - Make sure your whole family sleeps under a bed net every night.\r\n\r\n - Seek testing, and then treatment, from a doctor or health worker at the first sign of illness.\r\n\r\n - If you are given treatment, make sure to finish your pills!\r\n",
